\chapter{Preface}

The following text are my personal notes for the lecture \emph{Foundations in Representation Theory}, also known as \emph{Homological Algebra}, which is currently (winter semester 2018/19) being held at the University of Bonn by Dr.\ Hans Franzen.
The recommended literature is \cite{Working} for category theory, \cite[Chapter~1]{SheavesManifolds} and \cite{Weibel} for homological algebra, and \cite{Elements} for representation theory.
