\chapter{Preface}

The following text are my personal notes for the lecture \emph{Foundations in Representation Theory}, also known as \emph{Homological Algebra}, which is currently (winter semester 2018/19) being held at the University of Bonn by Dr.\ Hans Franzen.

The recommended literature are \cite{Working} and \cite{Schubert} for category theory, \cite[Chapter~1]{SheavesManifolds} and \cite{Weibel} for homological algebra, and \cite{Elements} for representation theory.
The author has also made good experiences with \cite{BasicCategory} und \cite{Brandenburg} for category theory.

The numbering of these notes is consistent with the one from the lecture.
I sometimes add remarks and statements which were not present in the lecture itself.
These parts are marked with the symbol~\textsuperscript{\extrasymbol} and use their own distinct numbering.
