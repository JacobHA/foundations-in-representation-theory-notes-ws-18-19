=================

This repository contains my personal notes for the lecture course _Foundations in Representation Theory_, which is currently being held at the University of Bonn in the winter semester of 2018/19 by Dr. Hans Franzen.
An up to date compiled version can be found [here][2].

For those who want to compile these notes themselves:

- Compiling is intented to be done using `lualatex`.
- The bibliography is using `biblatex` with the `biber` backend.
- The `gitinfo2` package is used to display the date and hash of the last commit.
- The included `make` file is intented for remote building via [travis.ci][3].
