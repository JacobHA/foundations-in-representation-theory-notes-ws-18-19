\section{Categories Without Enough Injectives}


\begin{example}
  \leavevmode
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      The category of finitely generated abelian groups has no injective objects aside from the trivial group~$0$:
      
      Every finitely generated abelian groups~$M$ is a finite direct sum
      \[
        M
        \cong
        \bigoplus_{n \geq 0}
        (\Integer/n\Integer)^{\oplus a_n}
      \]
      with~$a_n \geq 0$, and~$a_n = 0$ for almost all~$n$.
      The abelian group~$M$ is injective if and only if each direct summand is injective, by part~\ref*{direct summand of injective} of \cref{more on projectives and injectives}.
      But none of the~$\Integer/n\Integer$ is injective because the short exact sequence
      \[
        0
        \to
        \Integer/n
        \to
        \Integer/n^2
        \to
        \Integer/n
        \to
        0
      \]
      does not split.
    \item
      The same argument shows that the category of finite abelian groups has no injective objects aside from the trivial group~$0$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{example}
